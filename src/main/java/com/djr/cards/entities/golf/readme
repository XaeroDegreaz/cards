Golf is played by using six decks of cards, including the joker.
After shuffling the cards, the players draw cards from the "deck".  If the player draws exactly 15 cards the player gets
an immediate -5 points.
The players layout their drawn cards in a 5 by 3 grid face down.  If a player drew more than 15 cards, the remaining are
mixed back into the deck, if the player drew less than 15 cards, the player draws what is needed to get 15 cards.
At this point, players choose 3 cards in the deck to "turn" face up.
Play begins with the first play and continues clockwise.
There are "9" rounds of play.
The first card in the deck becomes the first discarded card on the first play of the round.

The player then has the choice of, to take the "last" discarded card to replace any card in his hand.
If the discarded card is not to his liking he can draw a different card and decide if he wants to replace any
card in his hand.  If not, he can discard the drawn card, which becomes the last discarded card.  If he does replace
a card in his hand, then the replaced card is discarded.

Play continues in this fashion until a player has "revealed" all 15 cards in his deck(out), at which time the all the other
players get one last turn following the above rules.  When the first out players turn again, then points are added and
 the round ends.

Points are decided by the face value of the cards and how the books are formed.  A book is the 3 cards in a column.

If two cards are the same and one is different(and not a joker) then those two cards don't count against you.  E.g.
Q
Q
5

In this case that book is +5.

If all three cards are the same(suits don't count as a different card) then you get -5 points.  E.g.
Q
Q
Q

If you have the case of a Joker and the other two cards are different then the highest point value card is cancelled
K
Jkr
5
In this case, the Joker gives -5 points, the King normally is +10 points but is cancelled by the Joker, and the 5 is +5
points.

If you have a Joker and two of the same card, then you get the -5 for the book and -5 for the Joker.
Jkr
Q
Q
This book is -10.

A book of Jokers is -5 for each Joker and -5 for the book, so -20 points.

The player at the end of the game with the fewest points(usually in the hundreds) wins the game.
