            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Danny Rucker.  I've been doing Java development work for 8 years now full time.  I went to
            Kansas State University where I earned my B.S. in Computer Science.  I'm using this application primarily to
            get a job in the Denver area and to showcase some of the technologies I have used.</p>
            <p>My goal with this game though is also to provide a way for my family who likes to play some of these games
            to be able to play them even though some of them are in different countries, and almost all of us in different
            states in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Why Denver?  My wife and kids are there and I am not.  I like it there because of the nature thing, but
            I'm not really a tree hugger, but if given the choice to run outdoors in Denver or outdoors in Kansas City, well
            I'd choose Denver.</p>
            <p>Questions or comments?  You can email me I suppose at djr4488 (at) gmail (dot, just one dot) com.</p>
