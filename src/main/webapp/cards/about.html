            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This project is mostly for me to teach myself various technologies I either want to use and provide a project to talk about at interviews.</p>
            <p>To that end I plan on implementing several card games but first I will implement my own card game.
            <ul>
                <li>Golf - I'll provide instructions to it later</li>
                <li>Since this open source any other card games others would like to implement feel free</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
