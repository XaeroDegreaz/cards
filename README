The purpose of this card game is to write a simple application for some popular card games using TomEE, Java, and a few other Java technologies.

Golf is a conversion of a game I originally had written using C# and Windows Desktop client and Windows Server applications.  

During the conversion, I've been stating to myself did I really write that?  Sadly, yes I did.

So part of this is to better organize and utilize Java technologies.  

Thanks for reading.

Goals - 
1. Complete the conversion of my golf game to Java making it web based.
2. Add additional games, like pitch and spades.
3. Always allow others to contribute in anyway they would like.

Layout -
Generally speaking I package by feature.
E.g. Authentication is in the auth package along with all of its required implementation details(except entities which are needed in other packages external to auth).

See /cards/wiki/Licensing for the Apache licensing I am choosing to release this under.
