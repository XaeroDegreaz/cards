The purpose of this card game is to write a simple application for some popular card games using 
TomEE, Java, and a few other Java technologies.

Golf is a conversion of a game I originally had written using C# and Windows Desktop client and 
Windows Server applications.  

During the conversion, I've been stating to myself did I really write that?  Sadly, yes I did.
So part of this is to better organize and utilize Java technologies.  With that said, I pretty
much suck at pretty UI design, I can write code at JSP levels and do .css but pretty css?  Not
too great at it, maybe I'll get better at it as time goes on.

Thanks for reading.
