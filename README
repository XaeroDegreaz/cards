The purpose of this card game is to write a simple application for some popular card games using TomEE, Java, and a few other Java technologies.

Golf is a conversion of a game I originally had written using C# and Windows Desktop client and Windows Server applications.  

During the conversion, I've been stating to myself did I really write that?  Sadly, yes I did.

So part of this is to better organize and utilize Java technologies.  With that said, I pretty much suck at pretty UI design, I can write code at JSP levels and do .css but pretty css?  Not too great at it, maybe I'll get better at it as time goes on.

Thanks for reading.

Goals - 
1. Complete the conversion of my golf game to Java making it web based.
2. Add additional games, like pitch and spades.
3. Always allow others to contribute in anyway they would like.
